# UnityDependencies

This project is a unity package that hosts the unity dependencies I'm currently using for my projects.
This is meant to be a "project bootstrapper" as I'm too lazy to add all package by hand each time ......

- [Add package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) from this git URL: https://github.com/touky/UnityDependencies.git#v1.0.4
- - v1.0.4 is the most recent and supported version
